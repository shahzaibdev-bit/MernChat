//*npm install nodemon -D
//*The -D flag is a shorthand for --save-dev. It means you're installing nodemon as a development dependency.

//!What is a Development Dependency?
//*Development dependencies are packages that are only needed during development (not in production). For example, tools like:
//*nodemon – automatically restarts your server on file changes.
//*eslint – for linting code.
//*jest – for testing.

//*These are not required when the app is running in production
